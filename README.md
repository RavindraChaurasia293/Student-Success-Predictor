Student Success Predictor – Machine Learning Model

This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict student academic success based on key performance and behavioral factors such as study hours, attendance, past scores, parental support, tutoring, and lifestyle indicators.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical application of core machine learning concepts, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, in a structured and reproducible manner.

🚀 Project Workflow

The project follows all essential steps of a real-world ML model:
